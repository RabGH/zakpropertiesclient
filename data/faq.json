      "question": "What is VAT and how does it affect real estate transactions in UAE?",
      "answer": "VAT is a value-added tax that is applied to the supply of goods and services in UAE. It is levied at a standard rate of 5%, except for some exempt or zero-rated supplies. VAT affects real estate transactions in UAE in different ways, depending on the type and purpose of the property. For example, the first supply of a new residential property within the first three years of its construction is zero-rated, which means no VAT is charged. However, the subsequent supply of the same property is subject to VAT at 5%. Commercial properties, on the other hand, are always subject to VAT at 5%, regardless of whether they are new or not. <Link href=\"https://vatregistrationuae.com/impact-of-vat-on-dubai-real-estate-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[source]</Link>"
